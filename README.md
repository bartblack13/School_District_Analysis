# School_District_Analysis
Python, Panda, Anaconda, &amp; Jupyter



## Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The Purpose of this project was to gain exposure to using Panda via Jupyter Notebook and Anaconda Prompt.  This project built upon what we learned in the previous week by using python based code.  In order to accomplish this, we were given a data set of student reading and math grades compiled for a school district.  This data set contained 39,170 rows of data and 7 columns of data.  I generated multiple other columns of data across all of the school.  Prior to data generation, I used panda to clean the data by removing prefixes, such as: Dr., Mr., and Mrs.; and suffixes such as: PhD., DVM., and MD. from student names; and I also removed 461 questionable student grades, per the district's instructions.  These grades were composed of the entire 9th grade class from Thomas High School.


## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.
  * How is the district summary affected?
  * How is the school summary affected?
  * How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
  * How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
      * Math and reading scores by grade
      * Scores by school spending
      * Scores by school size
      * Scores by school type

## Summary: Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
